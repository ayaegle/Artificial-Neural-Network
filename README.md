# Artificial-Neural-Network
This is a binary output Artificial-Neural-Network consists of a single Output Neuron.The network is capable of having many neurons within the hidden layer. In practice this works very well for simple problems, such as predicting the outcome for an AND gate.

The Format for an input file is

Number of inputs
Prompts for the users input
Prompts for the prediction results
data expected_value

Example Format: The AND Gate

3 (Number of inputs)
input1 (input prompt)
input2 (input prompt)
true (prediction results prompt)
false (prediction results prompt)
0 0 0 (data data expected_value)
0 1 0 (data data expected_value)
1 0 0 (data data expected_value)
1 1 1 (data data expected_value)
